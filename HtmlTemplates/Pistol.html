            McDonald's Pakistan Limited ("McDonald's") understands that privacy is important to its customers and is pleased to provide information to all of its customers about its privacy policy. Please be assured that McDonald's uses its best efforts to protect the privacy of visitors to this website and the privacy of its customers who provide personal information by other means to McDonald's.

             <p class="section-subtag  ">
                McDonald’s only gathers personal information, such as, first and last names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by you. When a product is purchased through this website or through marketing / promotional activities (e.g.: via this website, in a store, over the telephone etc.), personal information may be requested (such as name, phone, email and address) in order to provide product information, marketing materials, provide newsletters, electronic newsletters (e-newsletters), provide new release / launch information, and advise of other McDonald’s products, competitions or events, which may be of interest. No one is obligated to provide personal information. However, failure to do so may result in McDonald’s being unable to provide you with upcoming promotion, event or product information and/or provide certain services including sales of products and after sales services.
                <br><br>
                In common with many commercial websites we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to our website. For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of the website are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where the website is accessed via links in an email we have sent.

You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this website might not work without cookies and this may limit the services provided by our website.

            Many McDonald’s restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees, who are independent businessmen and women. Some franchisees also operate web sites. We encourage franchisees follow this privacy policy. However, please review the privacy policy of each web site to determine the privacy policies of that web site.
